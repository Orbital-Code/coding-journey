# Stock Prediction Project Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundations & Setup (2–3 weeks)

**Goal:** Get the skeleton of your project ready.

### Week 1

- Set up repo (GitHub/GitLab)
- Agree on folder structure (backend, frontend, ML, infra)
- Create a Django project (for the main backend) & a small Flask/FastAPI service for the prediction endpoint
- Basic Next.js + Tailwind project setup

### Week 2

- Create a stock price data pipeline (use Pandas, yfinance/Alpha Vantage API)
- Store data in PostgreSQL/MySQL
- Create a simple REST API (FastAPI) to serve stock data

### Week 3

- Design minimal frontend: Search stock → display last 7 days prices (React charts with Matplotlib/Recharts)
- CI/CD basic setup (GitHub Actions for auto-testing)

## Phase 2: ML Model (4–5 weeks)

**Goal:** Basic working ML stock predictor.

### Week 4

- Collect historical stock data (Pandas, yfinance/Alpha Vantage)
- Data cleaning & preprocessing pipeline

### Week 5

- Train baseline ML models (Linear Regression, RandomForest, XGBoost, LSTM if possible)
- Evaluate models (RMSE, MAPE)

### Week 6

- Serve model via Flask/FastAPI endpoint
- Connect frontend → API → Show predicted price for a stock

### Week 7

- Store predictions in MongoDB (for quick retrieval)
- Add a caching layer (Redis)

## Phase 3: Chatbot + RAG + Agentic (4–6 weeks)

**Goal:** Chatbot that explains predictions & provides stock insights.

### Week 8

- Set up LangChain + LangGraph basics
- Create a knowledge base from financial articles/reports
- Store embeddings in ChromaDB/Pinecone

### Week 9

- Implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) → User asks "Should I invest in TCS?" → Chatbot fetches data + prediction

### Week 10

- Add Agentic features:
  - The agent can fetch stock predictions from the ML API
  - The agent can summarise market news from the vector DB

### Week 11

- Integrate chatbot into frontend (Next.js chat UI)

## Phase 4: Full Product Integration (3–4 weeks)

**Goal:** End-to-end working product.

### Week 12

- Merge frontend + backend + chatbot into one flow
- Authentication (JWT via Django)

### Week 13

- Add dashboard (React charts for stock performance + predictions)
- UI/UX polish (Figma → Tailwind/MUI)

### Week 14

- Deploy ML API (Flask/FastAPI) + Django backend on Docker/Kubernetes
- Use AWS S3 for model/data storage

## Phase 5: DevOps + Scalability (ongoing)

**Goal:** Make it production-ready.

- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions → Docker → K8S)
- Nginx for API gateway
- Jenkins for automation
- Monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana later)
